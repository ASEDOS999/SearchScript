# Demonstration

There are different jupyter-notebooks for the demonstration of opportunities and problems of our approach for script extracting.


The short description of notebooks and links to them in the service [nbviewer.jupyter.org](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/).

* [Examples.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ASEDOS999/SearchScript/blob/SyntChildren/Demonstration/Examples.ipynb). There are examples of found actions and semantic relations.
* [SyntExamples.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ASEDOS999/SearchScript/blob/SyntChildren/Demonstration/SyntExamples.ipynb). There are examples of found actions and syntactic dependences.
* [VertAnalyses.ipynb](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/ASEDOS999/SearchScript/blob/SyntChildren/Demonstration/VertAnalyses.ipynb). There is analyses of information which graph of script will be constructed through. You can find statistics of found actions, their syntactic dependences and semantic relations with them. The statistics include number of found object, number of unique, of groups and distribution of objects number in the groups.
